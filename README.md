# bwamin
Ramen with a 'bw'. This is an aligner that takes in `.fa `and `.fq` files and aligns them to output a `.sam` file.

# How to use
## Example code
```
python3 bwamin.py --mem testfastring.fa testfqstring.fq
```

Under development. Currently, this only checks for exact matches from .fq onto .fa. 

`testfastring.fa` and `testfqstring.fq` can be replaced with your own `.fa` and `.fq` files.
